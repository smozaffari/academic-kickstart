I'm a statistical geneticist interested in disentangling the relationship between genotype and phenotype in humans. I'm a problem solver driven to help advance our field in decoding the genome. My two main interests focus on how our genomes have evolved (from my background in development and evolution); as well as understanding how genetic variation contributes to human disease.

I also enjoy sharing scientific knowledge, through discussion, art, and articles."
